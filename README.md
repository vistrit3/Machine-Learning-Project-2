# 🌍 Compact Multilingual Language Translator with Voice Recognition and Pronunciation Using Python

## 🧠 Overview

This project is a compact, intelligent multilingual translator designed to break language barriers with ease. It leverages **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Machine Learning** to deliver real-time language translation across multiple languages, paired with **voice recognition** and **pronunciation features**. Built in Python, it offers a practical solution for global communication, inclusive education, and cross-cultural collaboration.

## 💡 Features

- 🔄 **Multilingual Text Translation** — Translate between a wide range of languages with high accuracy.
- 🎤 **Voice Recognition Input** — Speak directly into the app for hands-free translation.
- 🔊 **Pronunciation Output** — Listen to translated text for better comprehension and language learning.
- 🖥️ **User-Friendly GUI** — Intuitive interface built using Tkinter.
- ⚙️ **Built with Python** — Utilizes libraries like `Googletrans`, `SpeechRecognition`, and `gTTS`.

## 📐 System Architecture

- **Frontend:** Python Tkinter GUI
- **Backend:** Google Translate API, SpeechRecognition engine
- **Text-to-Speech:** gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech)

## 🧪 Implementation Highlights

- Real-time translation with minimal latency
- Voice input in source language and audio output in English
- Dynamic language selection with support for lesser-known languages like Hmong, Uzbek, and Basque
- Modular design for easy extension and customization


## 🚀 Future Enhancements

- Integration with **context-aware translation models**
- Support for **regional dialects and low-resource languages**
- Offline translation mode for improved accessibility
- Advanced NLP features like **sentiment analysis**
- Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) compatibility
